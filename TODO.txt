TODO: test multiplication and addition speed double vs float on simplest examples
TODO: add branches and measure difference for above mentioned test
TODO: optionally, override the is_float_matrix to #define returning just true, compilation hopefully optimizes branching away
TODO: disassembly?

FIXME: mnist on float still fails to successfully train
FIXME 3: gradients (delta_weights etc.) seem to be zero in float training mode :-(
